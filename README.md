## Basic Overview of Project

The goal of the project is to take existing html, js, and css, and write a js file (server) to handle the ajax requests of the other files.  This was an exercise that reminded me how much easier it is to write both ends of the code to match up.  The main frustrations were with dealing with the existing code, all the code "should" link up nicely, as testing with small scale and also postman works perfectly parsing the json, writing to the files, just the provided interface seems to be missing items.

## Resources Used

Joe Rehfuss for the hot restaraunt activity walk throughs, made perfect sense how everything again *should* line up.


## Further Development Plans

I would love to figure out what is wrong with the base code that's not syncing up
